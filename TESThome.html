  <h2>How do you know what’s true anymore?</h2>
  <p>
    If you’ve felt overwhelmed, misled, or just unsure who to trust — you’re not alone.  
    I’ve felt it too. That’s why I’ve spent the time building something that helps make sense of it all — not with opinions, but with structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the tool I built 
    <a href="#tru-owl" class="important-link">T.R.U. Owl</a>   
    — a system that scores public figures based on  
    <span class="text-truth">truth</span>,  
    <span class="text-reliability">reliability</span>, and  
    <span class="text-understanding">understanding</span>.  
    It’s here so you don’t have to guess who’s credible anymore. You can see it for yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>So how do you know what’s true?</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve asked that same question too.
    Not as a journalist or politician, just as someone trying to make sense of a world full of contradictions. That’s why I built this system. 
    I use tools most people call “AI,” but really, they’re language models — and I use them literally: to improve how I write, break down complex topics, and build on things I’ve already created. 
    It helps me think more clearly — and when you think clearly, truth starts to show itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Objective truth vs subjective truth</h2>
  <p>
    Some things are objectively true — true whether we like them or not.  
    The Earth is round. That’s not an opinion. It’s a measurable fact.  
    That’s what we call a subjective truth: a belief someone feels in their gut, even when all the facts say otherwise.  
    One man even built a rocket to prove the Earth was flat. He launched himself into the sky… and died proving NASA right.  
    That’s why objective truth matters — it keeps us grounded in reality, no matter how loud the spin gets.
  </p>

  <h2>Citizenship Is a Fact — Voter Fraud Is a Fear</h2>
  <p>
    When you’re born, you get a birth certificate — proof of citizenship. That’s another objective truth. And with that comes the constitutional right to vote.
  </p>
  <p>
    What isn’t an objective truth is the belief that millions of undocumented immigrants are voting in our elections. That’s a narrative — not a fact. The idea of widespread voter fraud gets repeated so often that it feels real to some people. But it’s not backed by evidence. It’s a subjective fear that’s been turned into political fuel — and that’s exactly why we need systems grounded in verifiable truth.
  </p>

  <h2>Truth Deserves Better Tools</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="#tru-owl" class="important-link">T.R.U. Owl</a> system was built to help make patterns easier to see — 
    to separate objective truth from subjective spin. That includes helping people contextualize issues like voter fraud.
    You can explore it for yourself — just  
    <a href="#reality-check" class="important-link">select a state and see how many cases exist</a> 
    based on Heritage Foundation records. 
    The data speaks for itself: voter fraud is real, but it’s rare. 
    Context cuts through the noise — and that’s what this platform is all about.

  <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
  <p>
    We’ve been trained to care more about who said something than whether it’s true. 
    We’ve been stuck in a loop—team vs. team, headline vs. headline—while the truth gets lost somewhere in between. 
    That’s not sustainable. So I built a system that cuts through it.
  </p>

  <h2>The T.R.U. OWL Score</h2>
  <p>
    Truth. Reliability. Understanding. These three pillars make up the framework. 
    It’s not about politics—it’s about performance. Did they get the facts right? 
    Did they correct themselves when wrong? Do they actually understand the topic, 
    or are they just performing for clicks and applause?
  </p>

  <h2>It’s Not Just a Score</h2>
  <p>
    This system is designed to grow over time—with every subject scored and every correction made. 
    It tracks credibility the way it works in real life: you earn it, you lose it, and if you lie, you don’t get to just hit reset.
  </p>

  <h2>The End Goal</h2>
  <p>
    If more people start asking “Who’s telling the truth?” instead of “Whose side are you on?”—everything changes. 
    Politicians, media, journalists, and influencers—they’ll have to compete on honesty, not just volume. 
    This is how we take back the conversation.
