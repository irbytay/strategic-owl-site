T.R.U. OWL SCORING PROTOCOL v1.1
(Strategic Owl Credibility Scoring System)
Last updated: [Insert Date]

---

### PURPOSE
To evaluate public figures based on their credibility across three categories:
- Truth
- Reliability
- Understanding

This system measures not just factual accuracy, but the intent, framing, impact, and strategic value of public behavior — especially regarding threats or contributions to democratic institutions, civic trust, and public understanding.

---

### SCORING STRUCTURE
Each category is scored from +15 to –30, using the following logic tiers:

#### Truth Score (–30 to +15)
| Behavior Type                                            | Score |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Advances public understanding, debunks distortion        | +15   |
| Outstanding accuracy, primary sourcing                   | +10   |
| Mostly accurate with minor omissions                     | +5    |
| No clear pattern                                          | 0     |
| Spreads misinformation without correction                | –10   |
| Repeats known falsehoods after correction                | –20   |
| Promotes or engineers disinformation                     | –30   |

#### Reliability Score (–30 to +15)
| Behavior Type                                            | Score |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Transparent, consistently corrects, promotes accountability | +15 |
| Transparent, consistent, corrects errors                 | +10   |
| Generally steady, occasional missteps                    | +5    |
| Neutral or vague pattern                                 | 0     |
| Avoids correction, reframes mistakes                     | –10   |
| Denies or ignores factual exposure                       | –20   |
| Uses their platform for deception                        | –30   |

#### Understanding Score (–30 to +15)
| Behavior Type                                            | Score |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Demonstrates systems thinking, improves public understanding | +15 |
| Demonstrates systems thinking, context mastery           | +10   |
| Explains well, but lacks depth                           | +5    |
| Neutral / unclear pattern                                | 0     |
| Oversimplifies or distorts ideas                         | –10   |
| Misrepresents frameworks consistently                    | –20   |
| Weaponizes misunderstanding for influence                | –30   |

### CIVIC GROUNDING INDEX (CGI)
The CGI measures a figure's alignment with 10 core democratic principles.
Each principle is assessed using:

| Alignment           | Symbol | Score |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| ✅ Affirmative      | ✅     | +5     |
| ⚪️ Neutral / Unclear | ⚪️    | –1     |
| ❌ Contradictory    | ❌     | –5     |

#### Pillar Categories:
1. Elections are fair and secure (Elections)
2. Nonviolence is required in civic discourse (NonViolence)
3. Free press is essential (FreePress)
4. Offensive speech is still protected (FreeSpeech)
5. Government serves the public good (GovTrust)
6. Truth exists beyond media bias (MediaLiteracy)
7. Replacement theories are false and harmful (AntiReplacement)
8. Peaceful transfer of power is mandatory (Democracy)
9. Institutions should be reformed, not dismantled (Institutionalism)
10. The Constitution limits power, not enables abuse (CivicLimits)

Total CGI Range: –50 to +50

A neutral stance across all = –10 (soft red flag)
A civic-aligned public figure = +30 to +50

### STRATEGIC INTEGRITY FILTER
This override layer evaluates whether the person’s messaging or actions pose a threat to the public interest, even if factually accurate.

Apply an override deduction (–10 to –30) if their behavior:
- Undermines elections, civil liberties, free press, or rule of law
- Encourages violence, institutional distrust, or conspiratorial thinking
- Uses factually true statements to mislead or weaponize disinformation

---

### POSITION MULTIPLIER
After scoring T, R, and U, multiply their total by a position-based tier:

| Position                        | Multiplier |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| President / Cabinet / SCOTUS    | ×5         |
| Governor / Federal Official     | ×4         |
| Journalist / National Media     | ×3         |
| Influencer / Commentator        | ×2         |
| Local Figure / Minor Platform   | ×1         |
