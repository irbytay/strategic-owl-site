  <h2>How the T.R.U. OWL Score Works</h2>
<p>Each person is assessed across 10 core categories related to election security. Scores are assigned based on public statements, platform behavior, and alignment with verified facts.</p>
<ul class="score-legend tight">
  <li><span class="score positive-high">+10 to +6</span> Demonstrates high factual accuracy and civic literacy</li>
  <li><span class="score positive">+5 to +1</span> Shows general alignment with facts, but lacks clarity or depth</li>
  <li><span class="score neutral">0</span> No significant engagement or neutral presence</li>
  <li><span class="score negative">-1 to -5</span> Frequently misrepresents or oversimplifies key facts</li>
  <li><span class="score disinfo">-6 to -10</span> Spreads disinformation or undermines democratic systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total Score:</strong> A summation of all category subscores. This reflects a person's overall credibility on the topic of U.S. election security — not their ideology or political alignment.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> A person’s stance on the 2020 election is a strong signal within this system. In many cases, denial of verified results reflects not just misinformation, but loyalty signaling — making it a direct measure of truth vs. tribalism.</p>

<h2>Strategic Foundation - Election Security</h2>

<h3>Constitutional Knowledge</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Voting is a constitutional right — not a privilege handed out by politicians or protected by parties. Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed or strategically misleading.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The U.S. Constitution protects voting rights through multiple amendments: 1st (expression), 12th (electoral count), 14th (equal protection), 15th (race), 17th (Senate elections), 19th (gender), 23rd (D.C. electors), 24th (poll tax), and 26th (age).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The 12th Amendment defines how Electoral College votes are counted. It does **not** give the Vice President the authority to reject certified results — that’s a lie dressed as process.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> When people frame voting as a privilege, they distort constitutional truth. This distortion justifies exclusion — intentionally or not. Clarity on this category separates civic knowledge from manipulation.
</p>

<h3>Legal Framework</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections — this isn’t opinion, it’s federal law. Anyone claiming otherwise is either distorting the law or exploiting confusion.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Voter registration systems already require proof of citizenship: birth certificate, passport, or naturalization documentation. Claims that noncitizens are voting in mass are designed to provoke, not inform.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Three key laws govern voting access and oversight: the Voting Rights Act (1965), the National Voter Registration Act (1993), and the Help America Vote Act (2002). These laws exist to secure elections — not to rig them.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Legal misrepresentation fuels voter suppression. Understanding the actual laws — and how they're twisted — exposes efforts to restrict rather than protect democratic access.
</p>
<h3>Federalism</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, states control how elections are run — even for federal offices. That’s not a loophole; it’s the foundation of decentralized democracy.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      There is no centralized national voting system. Each state builds and manages its own process — by design. Attempts to override this are not about integrity; they’re about control.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Federalism isn’t just structure — it’s strategy. Knowing who controls what helps reveal when someone is bypassing accountability by blaming “the feds” or “the states.”
</p>
<h3>Election Mechanics</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Machine counts are statistically more accurate than hand counts — confirmed by decades of audit data. Those who push “hand counts only” are usually pushing doubt, not improvement.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Most states conduct risk-limiting audits — a scientifically proven method to verify outcomes and catch errors. It’s not just about recounts, it’s about confidence rooted in evidence.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Paper ballot backups are standard in nearly every state. They exist precisely to double-check machines. Pretending they don’t is a strategy, not a mistake.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Doubting machines works because people don’t know the safeguards. Falsehoods spread faster than tech facts. Knowing the mechanics restores grounded trust.
</p>
<h3>Electoral Count Process</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The 12th Amendment defines how Congress counts Electoral College votes — not how to dispute them. It outlines process, not power grabs.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The Vice President’s role is purely ceremonial. They open the envelopes — they don’t get to edit what’s inside. Any claim otherwise is political fiction.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Electoral votes come from the states after legal certification. Congress meets only to tally — not to veto. That’s how our system prevents chaos.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> The Vice President is ceremonial. Pretending otherwise isn't debate — it's destabilization. This process matters because it protects the handoff of power from personal agendas.
</p>
<h3>Disinformation Awareness</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Fact</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Disinformation is intentional deception; misinformation is accidental.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election — confirmed in over 60 court rulings.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Trump-appointed judges, DHS, and state officials (GOP and Dem) verified election legitimacy.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> People don’t need to lie to spread disinformation — just repeat it. The danger isn’t just the source, but the echo. Identifying intent helps separate confusion from corruption.
</p>
<h3>Public Impact</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Public figures shape how millions perceive reality — whether they intend to or not. Influence without responsibility is a liability to democracy.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Repeating false claims, even passively or under the guise of “just asking questions,” chips away at public trust and legitimizes chaos.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The act of correcting falsehoods — especially in front of an audience — isn’t just noble. It’s a marker of integrity and a civic responsibility.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Influence without correction spreads distortion. Even silence has consequence. A platform without responsibility becomes a megaphone for confusion.
</p>
<h3>Judicial Oversight</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      More than 60 court cases in 2020 — across both state and federal courts — found zero evidence of widespread voter fraud. That’s not an opinion. That’s legal record.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Many of those rulings came from Trump-appointed judges. When even your own bench calls the bluff, the argument collapses.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Landmark rulings like <em>Bush v. Gore (2000)</em> and <em>Moore v. Harper (2023)</em> define the constitutional limits of power in elections — not Twitter threads.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Courts don’t override elections — they uphold them. Judicial review is the firewall between law and lawlessness.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Courts are guardrails — but only if the public understands their role. Discrediting them without basis isn’t skepticism, it’s sabotage. Knowing how legal resolution works restores faith in resolution itself.
</p>
<h3>Election Worker Protections</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Fact</th></tr>
  <tr><td>After the 2020 election, election workers across the country were harassed, doxxed, and threatened with violence.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, Georgia workers, were falsely accused and targeted by Trump allies.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Some states have passed laws to increase penalties for threatening election officials or disrupting ballot counting.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Protecting election workers is essential for the functionality and fairness of the democratic process.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> When workers fear for their safety, democracy itself is at risk. Protecting them isn’t just policy — it’s a defense of the system’s human backbone.
</p>
<h3>Psychological Manipulation (Soversion Layer)</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Disinformation doesn’t rely on logic — it thrives on emotion. Repetition and fear short-circuit critical thinking, by design.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Election lies stick not because they’re convincing, but because they activate identity, grievance, and distrust. That’s how propaganda works.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      People often reject truth not out of ignorance, but out of self-protection — a product of tribal loyalty and motivated reasoning.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      When false beliefs fuse with identity and override reality, that’s not confusion — that’s <strong>Soversion</strong>: a rewiring of truth through ideological capture.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Soversion turns confusion into identity. The more people believe falsehoods reflect who they are, the harder truth becomes to hear. That’s not ignorance — that’s engineered entrenchment.
