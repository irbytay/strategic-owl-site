  <h2>How the T.R.U. OWL Score Works</h2>
<p>Each person is assessed across 10 core categories related to election security. Scores are assigned based on public statements, platform behavior, and alignment with verified facts. Each category typically ranges from <strong>+10 to -10</strong>, based on the following rubric:</p>

<ul class="score-legend tight">
  <li><span class="score positive-high">+10 to +6</span> Demonstrates high factual accuracy and civic literacy</li>
  <li><span class="score positive">+5 to +1</span> Shows general alignment with facts, but lacks clarity or depth</li>
  <li><span class="score neutral">0</span> No significant engagement or neutral presence</li>
  <li><span class="score negative">-1 to -5</span> Frequently misrepresents or oversimplifies key facts</li>
  <li><span class="score disinfo">-6 to -10</span> Spreads disinformation or undermines democratic systems</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why some scores exceed the scale:</strong> While most scores fall within the standard range, some individuals demonstrate behavior that goes well beyond typical engagement. In cases of exceptionally constructive or damaging actions — especially when influence, repetition, and intent are clear — the score may extend above +10 or below -10. This reflects not just what was said, but how persistently and powerfully it was used to inform or mislead the public.</p>
<p><strong>Total Score:</strong> A summation of all category subscores. This reflects a person's overall credibility on the topic of U.S. election security — not their ideology or political alignment.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> A person’s stance on the 2020 election is a strong signal within this system. In many cases, denial of verified results reflects not just misinformation, but loyalty signaling — making it a direct measure of truth vs. tribalism.</p>

<h2>Strategic Foundation - Election Security</h2>

<h3>Constitutional Knowledge</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Voting is a constitutional right — not a privilege handed out by politicians or protected by parties. Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed or strategically misleading.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The U.S. Constitution protects voting rights through multiple amendments: 1st (expression), 12th (electoral count), 14th (equal protection), 15th (race), 17th (Senate elections), 19th (gender), 23rd (D.C. electors), 24th (poll tax), and 26th (age).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The 12th Amendment defines how Electoral College votes are counted. It does **not** give the Vice President the authority to reject certified results — that’s a lie dressed as process.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> When people frame voting as a privilege, they distort constitutional truth. This distortion justifies exclusion — intentionally or not. Clarity on this category separates civic knowledge from manipulation.
</p>

<h3>Legal Framework</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections — this isn’t opinion, it’s federal law. Anyone claiming otherwise is either distorting the law or exploiting confusion.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Voter registration systems already require proof of citizenship: birth certificate, passport, or naturalization documentation. Claims that noncitizens are voting in mass are designed to provoke, not inform.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Three key laws govern voting access and oversight: the Voting Rights Act (1965), the National Voter Registration Act (1993), and the Help America Vote Act (2002). These laws exist to secure elections — not to rig them.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Legal misrepresentation fuels voter suppression. Understanding the actual laws — and how they're twisted — exposes efforts to restrict rather than protect democratic access.
</p>
<h3>Federalism</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, states control how elections are run — even for federal offices. That’s not a loophole; it’s the foundation of decentralized democracy.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      There is no centralized national voting system. Each state builds and manages its own process — by design. Attempts to override this are not about integrity; they’re about control.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Federalism isn’t just structure — it’s strategy. Knowing who controls what helps reveal when someone is bypassing accountability by blaming “the feds” or “the states.”
</p>
<h3>Election Mechanics</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Machine counts are statistically more accurate than hand counts — confirmed by decades of audit data. Those who push “hand counts only” are usually pushing doubt, not improvement.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Most states conduct risk-limiting audits — a scientifically proven method to verify outcomes and catch errors. It’s not just about recounts, it’s about confidence rooted in evidence.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Paper ballot backups are standard in nearly every state. They exist precisely to double-check machines. Pretending they don’t is a strategy, not a mistake.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Doubting machines works because people don’t know the safeguards. Falsehoods spread faster than tech facts. Knowing the mechanics restores grounded trust.
</p>
<h3>Electoral Count Process</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The 12th Amendment defines how Congress counts Electoral College votes — not how to dispute them. It outlines process, not power grabs.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The Vice President’s role is purely ceremonial. They open the envelopes — they don’t get to edit what’s inside. Any claim otherwise is political fiction.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Electoral votes come from the states after legal certification. Congress meets only to tally — not to veto. That’s how our system prevents chaos.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> The Vice President is ceremonial. Pretending otherwise isn't debate — it's destabilization. This process matters because it protects the handoff of power from personal agendas.
</p>
<h3>Disinformation Awareness</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Fact</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Disinformation is intentional deception; misinformation is accidental.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election — confirmed in over 60 court rulings.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Trump-appointed judges, DHS, and state officials (GOP and Dem) verified election legitimacy.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> People don’t need to lie to spread disinformation — just repeat it. The danger isn’t just the source, but the echo. Identifying intent helps separate confusion from corruption.
</p>
<h3>Public Impact</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Public figures shape how millions perceive reality — whether they intend to or not. Influence without responsibility is a liability to democracy.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Repeating false claims, even passively or under the guise of “just asking questions,” chips away at public trust and legitimizes chaos.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      The act of correcting falsehoods — especially in front of an audience — isn’t just noble. It’s a marker of integrity and a civic responsibility.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Influence without correction spreads distortion. Even silence has consequence. A platform without responsibility becomes a megaphone for confusion.
</p>
<h3>Judicial Oversight</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      More than 60 court cases in 2020 — across both state and federal courts — found zero evidence of widespread voter fraud. That’s not an opinion. That’s legal record.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Many of those rulings came from Trump-appointed judges. When even your own bench calls the bluff, the argument collapses.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Landmark rulings like <em>Bush v. Gore (2000)</em> and <em>Moore v. Harper (2023)</em> define the constitutional limits of power in elections — not Twitter threads.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Courts don’t override elections — they uphold them. Judicial review is the firewall between law and lawlessness.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Courts are guardrails — but only if the public understands their role. Discrediting them without basis isn’t skepticism, it’s sabotage. Knowing how legal resolution works restores faith in resolution itself.
</p>
<h3>Election Worker Protections</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Fact</th></tr>
  <tr><td>After the 2020 election, election workers across the country were harassed, doxxed, and threatened with violence.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, Georgia workers, were falsely accused and targeted by Trump allies.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Some states have passed laws to increase penalties for threatening election officials or disrupting ballot counting.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Protecting election workers is essential for the functionality and fairness of the democratic process.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> When workers fear for their safety, democracy itself is at risk. Protecting them isn’t just policy — it’s a defense of the system’s human backbone.
</p>
<h3>Psychological Manipulation (Soversion Layer)</h3>
<table>
  <tr><th>Facts</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Disinformation doesn’t rely on logic — it thrives on emotion. Repetition and fear short-circuit critical thinking, by design.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Election lies stick not because they’re convincing, but because they activate identity, grievance, and distrust. That’s how propaganda works.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      People often reject truth not out of ignorance, but out of self-protection — a product of tribal loyalty and motivated reasoning.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      When false beliefs fuse with identity and override reality, that’s not confusion — that’s <strong>Soversion</strong>: a rewiring of truth through ideological capture.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="strategic-insight">
  <strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Soversion turns confusion into identity. The more people believe falsehoods reflect who they are, the harder truth becomes to hear. That’s not ignorance — that’s engineered entrenchment.
