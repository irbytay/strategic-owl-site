      <p><strong>This isn’t a media bias site. It’s a truth system.</strong></p>
      <p>The T.R.U. OWL Score is a credibility framework that measures public figures based on <span class="text-truth">verifiable truth</span> — not vibes, tribes, or talking points.</p>
      <p>We don’t ask what side someone’s on. We ask: <em>Did they tell the truth?</em> Did they correct themselves when wrong? Are they consistent? Do they understand what they’re talking about?</p>
      <p>Through <strong>court records</strong>, <strong>public data</strong>, and <strong>source-backed analysis</strong>, we track what can be proven — and score it across three pillars:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="text-truth">Truth</span> – Are the claims factually accurate?</li>
        <li><span class="text-reliability">Reliability:</span> – Are they consistent and accountable?</li>
        <li><span class="text-understanding">Understanding:</span> – Do they grasp the systems they discuss?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each role is measured differently — because journalists aren’t lawmakers, and influencers aren’t investigators. But all are held to <strong>real standards</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>This is about course-correction — not cancellation.</strong> We reward accuracy, transparency, and integrity. We expose distortion, evasion, and disinformation.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> In a world where influence often outruns accountability, the T.R.U. OWL Score changes the incentive structure. It rewards those who elevate truth — and reveals those who erode it.</p>
      <p><span class="text-truth">Truth</span> isn't a matter of opinion — it’s a record. And now, for the first time, you can see it clearly, compare it publicly, and use it strategically.</p>
      <p>This system exists not to play favorites, but to make <strong>credibility visible</strong> — so that public trust can be earned, not assumed. When <span class="text-truth">truth</span> becomes visible, <span class="text-reliability">accountability</span> follows — and that’s how we move forward.</p>
